# Challenge 05
### BookShelf

### Mustache library was used to render the books dynamically. The rest of things were made with Vanilla JS.


JSON model stored in `books.json` 

Script to get the info from the API is `getBookInfo.js`

ES6 code and Sass files were transpiled using Babel. Gulp was used for monitoring those files. 

Please do a `npm install` in order to install all the dependencies needed.
